        <h2> The Purriest Place Around! </h2>
        <p> We are a cafe that works alongside the Animal Humane Society to provide the best of both worlds, a sanctuary for animals in overfilled shelters and a fun, relaxing place for animal lovers to meet and interact with our friendly cats. Due to high demand we have finally added a brunch menu! Indulge in the best snack foods our chef has to offer.</p>
