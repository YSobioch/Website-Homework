            <td> Buster is anything but your stereotypical ragdoll cat. While he's just as cute as the breed normally is, he's got some spunk. There's nothing he loves more than playing with a feather on a stick covered in catnip. Definitely a companion for the highspirited with a love for play.</td>

            <td> Luna is the perfect foil for Buster, shy and a bit skittish. Though, for the right person, or a consitent customer, she's the sweetest lapcat in the world. Though she may hide, she's a curious girl, willing to come out to smell and play with something she's never seen before. </td>
